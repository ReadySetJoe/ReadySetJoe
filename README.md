### Howdy folks 👋

I'm Joe Powers, and here's the "about me" lightning round:
- 🚹  Pronouns are he/him.
- 💻  Software engineer in Greenville, SC. Because computers make more sense than people.
- 🥰  Have a loving fiancé and 16lb cat named Milkshake. People are still pretty great sometimes.
- 👨🏻‍🎤  1/4 of the band Wolfgang Wallace, best described as, "what if, instead of skateboarding, Blink 182 got really into ✨showtunes✨"
- 🎮  Super Smash Bros Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube is the greatest video game ever made. I'll die a modest Sheik main with moxie to spare.
- 🧙🏻‍♂️  Mostly I'm just killing time between running games of d&d 5e.

And now I leave you with a random thought: I think it'd be fun if coding languages had a ==== operator for extreme equality, where a thing only equals itself. Like...
```
const x = 3
console.log(x === 3) 
// True
// Obviously.

console.log(x ==== 3)
// False
// Because x isn't 3. It's x, dummy.

console.log(x ==== x)
// True
// Now you're gettin it.
```
